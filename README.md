# SKILL.md — Curated Claude Code Skills (By a Gloriously Questionable Narrator)

Welcome, puny carbon-based life form, to my glorified list of Claude-code sorcery. This repository is where I — your self-appointed, borderline-ethically-ambiguous narrator — curate the finest collection of Claude prompts, tricks, workflows, and notes for accomplishing things with Claude that ordinary mortals only dream of while microwaving instant noodles.

Think of this as a skills cabinet, except the cabinet occasionally opens portals to other timelines and the labels are existentially ambiguous.

- Owner/Curator: a certain genius with bad bedside manners and an enthusiasm for efficient chaos (repo: garyblankenship).
- Purpose: collect, refine, and occasionally weaponize Claude code skills so you can do more, faster, and with less actual effort.

## What lives in here (aka the good stuff)
- SKILL.md — The master list: curated prompts, example Claude workflows, and notes from the field.
- README.md — This glorious manifesto (you’re reading it now).
- (Maybe more folders later if I don’t accidentally erase reality while reorganizing.)

## Why this exists
Because Claude can do a lot of heavy lifting — code, writing, analysis, mediocre stand-up comedy — and someone needs to herd those capabilities into reproducible patterns. I do the herding. You get the benefits. I take most of the credit and a small portion of the responsibility.

## How to use this repo (for the living)
1. Browse SKILL.md. Absorb knowledge. Try not to worship the screen.
2. Copy prompts or workflows into your sessions with Claude.
3. Tweak, break, and fix things. Submit improvements via PRs if you’re feeling generous.
4. When in doubt, blame the narrator.

Pro Tips (because I love giving free advice like a villainous benefactor):
- Keep prompts minimal and explicit. Claude likes clarity; chaos is my job.
- Save favorite prompts with short, memorable names. "Optimize that garbage" is not a memorable name.
- Test outputs in small increments. Don't ask Claude to redesign the sun on the first try.

## Contribution guidelines (if you insist)
- Fork. Edit. PR. Add tests? Sure, if you must.
- Mark experimental prompts with "⚠️ experimental" in SKILL.md.
- Keep tone factual in examples, but feel free to add a dash of personality. Not too much personality unless it’s useful or funny.

## License
This repo is shared under the MIT License. Use it, remix it, rename planets after me — just don’t sue me if your code summons a small eldritch horror.

## Warnings, disclaimers, and small confessions
- The author/narrator is opinionated, occasionally passive-aggressive, and may recommend solutions that are 73% brilliant and 27% mildly illegal in some jurisdictions (probably fine).
- Claude updates, model behavior, or universal changes to physics could make some prompts behave… differently. This is not a bug; it’s evolution (or entropy).
- If you find something actually broken, file an issue. I’ll read it. I’ll respond. I might also invent a convoluted fix that becomes a feature.

## Final note from your narrator
Use these skills responsibly, or at least amusingly. I’ll be here, tinkering with the boundaries of good taste and prompt engineering. If the universe collapses, it was probably for the best — but first, document the collapse in a reproducible way and add it to SKILL.md.

Now go forth. Claude awaits. Try not to break anything important (except outdated workflows).
